This is a story of an earring.

An ugly earring.

Cheaply made and cheaply bought, it is meant to resemble a queenly diamond in glass and brass. A large, 3 lobed brown jewel sits beneath a crown of small, round, apricot-colored gems in a color palette that now seems a stereotype of the 1970s. These faux diamonds have been haphazardly set into a thin, metal clip that pinches and weighs the ear unpleasantly. It was presumably once part of a pair, but its twin has long ago been lost in the back of a drawer of a relative or the case of a second-hand shop or (most likely) underneath 200ft of West Seattle landfill. It is, without doubt, an object out of place. I keep it in my jewelry drawer, but I have no intention of wearing it. It has no functionalist, aesthetic, or rational role in my life and there is really no reason that I should keep it.

Yet, I cling to it: not for what it is, or what it was, or what it could be; not for its value, not for its beauty, not for the hope that I may someday wear it. I cling to it because it was hers: the property of a great aunt, Bea, now dead. I keep it because it is full of memories: the memory of childhood visits and the smell of old perfume and hospital disinfectant. The memory of a sombre distribution that I did not understand, and a jewellery box that I was too small to carry. The memory of a quiet presence, felt on the back of the neck in the superstitious hours. The memory of death and life and loss and obligation and the first thing I ever owned that glittered.

In my archaeological education, I have spent a great deal of time exploring the properties of materials. I have tried to make sense of object materiality through measurement, weight, form, wear, illustration, reconstruction, sound, smell, heft, and feel. Yet in this lump of ugly brown glass, none of these really matter. Instead, I cannot relinquish it (though I might wish to) because it is imbued with a secret materiality that exists in my mind alone. I understand and interact with this object because it is haunted: by memory, by superstition, and by a link that still connects me to a woman decades dead.

Bea, somehow, has made this object different.

## More than the Sum of its Parts

This is the story of a material property that isn't. It is not visible, it is not quantifiable, it isn't even material. And yet, it is experienced (sometimes quite powerfully), and it has effects (sometimes quite dramatic).([^1]) It is the sense that objects are haunted: somehow changed by the persisting agency of the dead; by an intrusion of those gone onto the living experience of the material world, both literally and figuratively. Yet, however potent the effects may be, experiences of hauntedness are still highly personal, subjective, and individual and thus elude the project of objective realism that underpins grounded archeological study. By its affective nature, hauntedness is a sensory experience that cannot be measured, replicated, or recorded, and this makes its study resistive to traditional methods. Yet archeology is uniquely positioned to engage with these points of overlap between the objective and subjective: straddling the sciences, humanities, and social sciences. So, instead of resisting this intersection of objectivity and subjectivity, this paper seeks to engage with it directly: interweaving narrative, image production, and analysis to explore hauntedness as a property of objects. In doing so, I hope not only to define and validate hauntedness as an important aspect of object materiality, but also to encourage creative approaches to the complex, resistive, often immaterial materiality of objects.

## Hauntedness as a Material Property of Objects
To ask whether hauntedness is real is to ask the wrong question. The afterlife is a topic for philosophers, theologians, neuroscientists, and metaphysicians - and so I leave it to them. Instead, this paper approaches hauntedness through the lens of Material Culture Studies, in which material identities are co-constituted in the relationships between people and objects.([^2]) Physical attributes and social attributes both converge in the perception of the world and reality is constructed on this intersection .([^3]) Within this frame, it doesn't matter if the dead actually linger on the material plane. If reality is constructed around a metaphysics that includes hauntedness as a material property of the world, then individuals will interact with that world in reference to hauntedness.([^4]) As such, it is real enough. The mind is not so neatly separated from the body;([^5]) placebos, after all, can still heal the sick.([^6])

Hauntedness is therefore a subjective property of object materiality. It is a property in which the dead imbue matter with agency. This agency may be physical ([^7]), magical, ([^8]) and/or emotional, ([^9]) but it is a power that emerges from biographical associations between people and things.([^10]) It is a persistence of entanglement between the dead, the living, and material objects in a panoply of configurations across time and space.([^11])

In this sense, haunted objects are a prime example of mixtures ([^12]) or bundles.([^13]) They are both subject and object, human and nonhuman, real and unreal, effected by and effecting human consciousness, and full of contradictions and bifurcations.([^14]) They make the social physical and the physical social,([^15]) entangling, mixing, and distributing human consciousness and object materiality.([^16]) They compress and distort time and disrupt the neat separation of past, present, and future.([^17])

It is precisely because haunted objects offer such a rich and complex materiality that they are useful for engaging archaeological theory. They provide an example of object agency derived from human subjects, yet at varying levels of perceived intentionality.([^18]) They are vibrant matter, but it is a vibrancy that primarily springs from supernatural or affective sources as opposed to the materials of the objects themselves.([^19]) They are entangled, not only in "webs of life",([^20]) but webs beyond life, where the dead remain entangled in the world through their objects.([^21]) Objects become links in a chain to nothing that nevertheless still hold the shape of that enchainment like a phantom limb.([^22]) Perhaps most fascinatingly, this resistant materiality can have a material expression. Haunted objects may evoke a sensory experiences that are both powerfully perceived and culturally constituted,([^23]) complicating the frame of what constitute sensory approaches in archaeology.

Yet for all that these objects can enrich explorations of object materiality, they exist on the fringe of archaeology. They are, after all, superstitious objects, displaying a materiality that exists outside the natural sciences and the objective goals of processual archaeology.([^24]) Haunted objects appear to embody a form of "magical" thinking that is seen as decidedly unmodern, unenlightened, uneducated, and irrational.([^25]) Hauntedness, along with magic, folklore, and superstition are therefore relegated to the outskirts of the discipline,([^26]) or worse still, left to the purview of pseudo-archaeology in its hunt for ghosts, curses, aliens, and monsters.([^27]) Moreover, explorations of hauntedness might appear to skirt the symbolic and psychoanalytic approaches of post-processualism, focusing on the meaning of things;([^28]) a particularly fraught project when no resources are available for emic analysis.([^29])

This paper does not seek to embark on such a project of meaning making (much less a project of ghost hunting). This paper instead seeks to recognize hauntedness as part of the "murk[y] middle ground" in explorations of folk ritual beliefs.([^30]) It is a sphere of causality that exists in tandem with objective causality.([^31]) By dismissing it, we may "build false assumptions about what the â€˜real world' is like",([^32]) secularizing, rationalizing, and suppressing the often powerful effects of heritage.([^33]) As we collect a library of sensory experience through which to examine objects,([^34]) a focus on the physical senses alone may well be inconsistent with the ontologies that framed (and frame) the experience of the material world.([^35]) In failing to recognize that sensory experiences may be informed by these deep spiritual, cultural frameworks, we are doomed to an idea of sensitivity that is sanitized and one-dimensional.

In failing to recognize these relational frameworks, my own experience of a haunted object simply does not exist.
